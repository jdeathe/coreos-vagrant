# Packages Source

The directory packages/src should contain source files for docker containers used in the project - this must be at least a Dockerfile but will usually include necessary configuration files startup scripts etc required by the Dockerfile and also helper scripts to assist building and running on the CoreOS VM. A sub-directory should exist for each vendor/user.
